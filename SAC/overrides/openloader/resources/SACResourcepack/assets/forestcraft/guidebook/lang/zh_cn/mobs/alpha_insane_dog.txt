These insane dogs are|
the leaders among the|
common.  All nearby insane|
dogs will follow and hunt|
together.  This mob is|
extremely dangerous and capable|
of handling a reckless|
target. There is probably|
something more  terrible behind|
them, which is the reason|
for the  appearance of|
these dogs. They spawns in|
bone lairs  in the desert.|
