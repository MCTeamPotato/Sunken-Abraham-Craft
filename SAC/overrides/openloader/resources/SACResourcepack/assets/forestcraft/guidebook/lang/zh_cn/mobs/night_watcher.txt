Sometimes it seems|
like someone is watching|
you. What if it  | doesn't|
really seem like it's better|
to leave the house and|
check. These creatures|
appear when you decide to|
lie down to sleep again.|
They will not touch you,|
but you woun't be able to|
sleep in their presence.|
This is a creature of the|
end and also can|
teleport, only not itself but|
you.
