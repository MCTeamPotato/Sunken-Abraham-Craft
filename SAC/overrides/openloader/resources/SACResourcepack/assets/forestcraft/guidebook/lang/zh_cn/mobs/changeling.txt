The changelings are cute|
creatures who appreciate|
people's attention.|
It's probably for this|
reason that when they see|
you, they will immediately|
start chasing you.|
Sometimes they appear just|
by chance near the player,|
but they can also be found|
in ordinary forests.|
Isn't it a wonderful creature?
