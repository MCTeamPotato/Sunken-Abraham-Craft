Cute forest dweller|
who poses no threat to|
living creatures. It can be|
fed with a dandelion and|
propagated in this way. The|
fluff obtained from it is|
very soft, and the block|
made of this fluff fully|
protects against fall damage.|
It will spawn in small|
flower hills that generate|
in the forest.
