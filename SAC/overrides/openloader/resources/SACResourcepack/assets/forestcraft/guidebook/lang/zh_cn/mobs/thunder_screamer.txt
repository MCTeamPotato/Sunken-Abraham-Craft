When the sky is|
covered  with clouds, and|
lightning strikes constantly|
nearby, there is a chance to|
meet this strange|
creature. It will not touch the|
player first, but if|
provoked, you  can say goodbye|
to life. The electric|
shocks of these creatures|
are extremely deadly, but|
you can still make|
Electresistance Potion.
