A sea monster that|
loves to hunt players and|
squids. If he chose you as|
his target, he will begin|
to circle nearby,|
periodically imposing blindness|
and weakness, making|
jerks in your direction.|
After being killed in your|
world, aquamarine begins to|
generate in the sea. It rarely|
spawns in the depths of the|
oceans.
