It is not known|
exactly why these dogs are so|
different from wolves. If the|
insane dog gets close enough|
to you, it is capable of|
releasing redstone-breath|
that eats away at living|
tissue. They cannot be tamed,|
but you can force|
them to recognize you as a|
leader using the Insane|
Helmet. They spawns in bone|
lairs in the desert.
